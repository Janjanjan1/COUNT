# Framework Of Choice:

- we are going to use Flutter for Frontend Development. This is because we only have to develop the frontend once, and it can be run on most devices out there. 
- a lot of frontend development jobs are in flutter and the only two contenders are react native or flutter in this develop once and run in everything space.
- flutter was a personal choice because i have a sort of fear of learning react let alone react native. this is why we are going to use flutter.
